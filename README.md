# CIS453L_Garland
Week 5 CIS 453L Final Project
By:Jennifer Garland

I found a website to a local shop here in Virigina Beach that needed a lot of changes to be more user friendly and asthethictly appealing.  
The original site is https://ocean-waves-gift-shop-bike-rentals.business.site/.  I have turned this single page into a multi-page navigation 
site, with the ability to leave comments, check for bike rental availability, as well as clearly see what the shop has to offer as far as 
merchandise, and bike rental pricing.  None of this was available at the original site.  

This page is currently published at  https://jengar8694.github.io/CIS453L_Garland/
